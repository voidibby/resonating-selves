_I died on Facebook_ is a game experience set in a cemetery, where Facebook profiles have been memorialized by their loved ones.
The artwork prompts us to contemplate the impact of our immaterial selves on our physical lives, and the consequences of prioritizing our online personalities. Must we consider the fate of our digital counterparts when we die? Do they exist indefinitely, or do they perish as well?
Visitors interact differently on-site or on the Internet, enabling a multi-layered engagement.
