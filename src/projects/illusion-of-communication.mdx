Can we achieve perfect communication?
The artwork consists of three parts: 'Confiding', 'Sharing', and 'Spreading'. Users can experience unique communication.Â 
'Confiding': user conversations are transformed into visuals.
'Sharing': is an open space for artist performances and translation.
'Spreading': users share their stories speaking into a sculpture. It records and transforms stories, which are then randomly played through holes in the sculpture. People can hear stories from others and leave their own stories anonymously.
