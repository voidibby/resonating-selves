Reality is always mediated by our perspective. Screens, through which we observe much of the modern world, continues the ancient Greek tradition of playing with our perception of images.
Furthermore, reality is mediated by technology. _Parallax Window_ creates an interface in which perception is not a passive act of observation but an active engagement with the world. The work allows us to see the gap between different viewpoints, creating a parallax effect.
