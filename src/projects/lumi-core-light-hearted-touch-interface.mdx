_LumiCore: Light-hearted Touch Interface_ blends art and science, fusing tactile and visual elements with the aim of creating an interactive environment to take you on an immersive journey beyond ordinary perception.

Visitors are warmly encouraged to engage with and explore illuminated pillars, bending, flexing, and interacting with them to immerse themselves in this mesmerizing realm and leave their ethereal imprint on the work of art.

In collaboration with Ingrid Graz/JKU (AT)
