_Data Trail Diary_ explores current mass surveillance. Previously limited and more targeted by its physical, visible presence, surveillance is now being replaced by a relentless digital ghost, ever-present in all layers of our lives.

This work is ambiguous, but also very personal and aims to bring back long-lost familiarity and physical presence of surveillance authority, while exploring the possibilities of ethical personal data storage, without losing the spirit of automatization.
