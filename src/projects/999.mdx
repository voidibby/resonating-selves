_999_ is a virtual reality project researching the realm of psychedelic entities. Users embark on a mind-altering digital journey, through an immersive and transformative trance.
Users don VR headsets and enter this ethereal landscape, greeted by a pulsating rhythmic soundtrack guiding them into a state of heightened awareness. This multi-sensory feast of visuals, soundscapes, and interactive elements simulates a post-cyberdelic experience.
