Welcome to _Laser Talk Linz_, organised by the Interface Cultures department at University of Art and Design Linz. In 2021, Linz joined the Leonardo LASER network.

We continue our series "Danube Songs" looking into water as medium. Artists, curators, scientists, designers and architects will explore how artistic and scientific works have shaped agendas and personal relationships with this sensitive force of nature.

**Hosts:** Prof. Christa Sommerer (AT) & Fabricio Lamoncha (ES)
