Recalling a past memory involves various areas of the brain and distribution throughout our neural networks. While retrieving a memory, it becomes susceptible to modification.
_Reconsolidated Memories_ is an interactive video installation using pictures from the artist\'s archive to illustrate how memories are processed and manipulated by the brain. Our memories are not static, but constantly evolving. The longer a visitor observes, the more distorted the memories become, reflecting the phenomenon of reconsolidation.
