The performance is a result of a collaborative and experimental encounter between transdisciplinary artists (APBU– Dance Institute, Kunstuniversität Linz–Interface Cultures) and scientists from the Institute of Quantum Optics and Quantum Information. It showcases a multitude of diffracted artistic interpretations of the key research questions within the field of quantum physics and philosophy–from quantum entanglement and quantum gravity, space-time the motion of molecules–to chaos, superposition and Ancient Chinese Ontology.

The work depicts the beauty of nature generated by a set of algorithms, representing our connection to the natural world in the age of artificial intelligence.

The visual designs use VVVV to merge concepts of quantum systems (particle motion, uncertainty and oscillation) with the movements of the performers, while reacting to a soundtrack that explores the same ideas, incorporating oscillation data provided by the QISS lab, Vienna.
