In the eyes of progress, the past is immutable. It is a crystallized mineral. It is a continuously growing, exponential segment. All the points form that line we call "history"; blessed and sacred events that have shaped our world as it is today. How can we get rid of History?
_Future[past]_ is a speculative device sent to Earth to process the past and transform futures. By means of an AI, it configures multiple new possible past futures, escaping ecological, political, economic and social uncertainty that defines our present, imagining other futures.
