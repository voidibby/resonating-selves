In philosophy of mind, qualia is defined as instances of subjective and conscious experience. The perceived quality of experience is how it feels from the inside, how it is presented, and how things seem to us.
The artwork _Qualia_ is an individual immersive experience, which seeks to alter the viewer\'s perceptually diverse range of experiencing realities. Through an optical and virtual sonic landscape, the user is induced to encounter the \'reality\', which is juxtaposed inside the eyeball and the image from outside.
