AI Flowers is part of the artist's generative sculpture series. It explores vibrant colours and fluid movements inspired by natural phenomena, using AI-generated imagery and motion simulation.
By hand-picking pictures of flowers, a custom dataset was created for a machine-learning model. As a result, it generates surreal flowers and repurposes them with fluid particles, creating a generative sculpture. The work depicts the beauty of nature generated by a set of algorithms, representing our connection to the natural world in the age of artificial intelligence.
