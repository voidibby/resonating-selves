Language founds realities. Deployed vision machines encapsulate, label, and categorize bodies through words. Image processing machines categorize bodies that fit into a binary worldview of gender. Reality is much more complex, a multitude of shades of grey.
_Unlearning Gender_ speculates on alternative modes of categorisation to resist algorithmic-binary normalization. Through the symbolic hacking of the computer vision interface, the project aims to escape from gender and break with the technosocial binarisms embedded in technology.
