Imagine being part of a network of devices. Data management sheds light on organizational challenges, misinterpretation, and information transfer failure in your community.
"A Mesh/Mess Of Beings" envisions an ecosystem where non-human entities prioritize their own interests, exploring absurd-yet-plausible relationships between familiar electronic devices. Devices are evolving into citizens of their own societies. This work hints at the potential for political interventions in human organizational design by transforming their functions and aesthetics.
