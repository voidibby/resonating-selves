Since I moved to Europe, I've often felt like an outsider because of the color of my skin. Advertisements here typically feature only white people, which reinforces my perception of being a foreign object as an Asian.
Public art is an essential medium for finding my place in society.
I used high-resolution images of my skin texture to fill in my silhouette and scattered it throughout the city for people who don't want to see my insides.
After I experienced racism, _Skin Street_ encourages me to interact with society and expand my comfort zone in this new city.
