In "@theorchid_beauty", the orchid, becomes a cyborg in symbiosis with social media, revealing the relationship between capitalism and nature.
This orchid survives on Instagram likes. It has its own Instagram and uses it for its own needs. When it needs water, it posts a selfie on Instagram and gets watered with likes.
The anthropocentric culture of likes are phenomena that orchids, like many other species, have been exposed to for many years. This project explores potential discourses and questions about human-nonhuman relationships.
