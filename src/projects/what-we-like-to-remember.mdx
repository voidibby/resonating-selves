_What we like to remember_ is a performance and sound installation, gathering four artists from the University of Art and Design Linz at Interface Cultures. to inquire about the nature of memory and community.
Through short nonlinear storytelling, we hope to address disorientation, dislocation and longing for home, while living in a culture and trying to speak in a language, which is not our own.
