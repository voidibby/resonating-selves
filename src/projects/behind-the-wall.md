Are Scratched-out wall writings just an eyesore or are they vital messages?

Writings on walls are used as a form of self-expression in the societies where there is lack of freedom of speech.

_Behind the wall_ creates an AR portal, to show there is a life buried beneath the scratched words, revealing the message which the wall seeks to convey.

This project aims to raise questions about the suppressed voices in society and raise public awareness about basic human rights.
