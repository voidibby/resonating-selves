_Raindrop Price Index_ features two generative animations based on measurements of terrestrial ecosystems' water balance cycles.
The artist challenges the idea capturing ecosystem value through big data and natural capital accounting.
The artwork uses the ClimateEngine's 2011-2021 TerraClimate dataset, processed by Google Earth and obtained from NOAA and NASA by the University of Idaho's researchers. We pay homage to the Aral Sea tragedy, and we reflect on the interplay between nature, society, and economic systems.
