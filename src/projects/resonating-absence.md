_Resonating Absence_ is inspired by a feeling defined by the untranslatable word Awumbuk. This refers to the melancholy and sense of emptiness that lingers after visitors have left. The work detects the presence and movement of the viewers and attempts to communicate with them, establishing contact, only to return, once left alone, to a state of silent stagnation. This is a reflection on the fragility of interpersonal relationships, encounters and the state of agitation induced by the fear of facing the void.
