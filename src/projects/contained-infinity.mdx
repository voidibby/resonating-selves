_Contained Infinity_ explores the philosophical themes behind Khayamiya, the art of tentmaking. Khayamiya art is a visual representation of the Egyptian community and identity.

Assemblage of Infinitesimals is a mathematical term, is based on the same philosophical principles. It refers to the process of summing up an infinite number of small values. _Contained Infinity_ examines how humans, as simple components are combined to create a cohesive and comprehensive visual composition. It also investigates how a single point can unfold to reveal an entire universe.
