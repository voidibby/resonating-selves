This work explores the personal interior and dissolves it through collective interaction. Participant occupying the space are scanned to reveal layers of a hybrid human radiological volume. As these build, more of its form is revealed. Meanwhile, the number and proximity of individuals creates distortionary fields -- blending this form into a stellar constellation. The cumulative effects of these scans and fields accelerates and expands over time until the constellation novas into self-oblivion and the cycle begins anew.
